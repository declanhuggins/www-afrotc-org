# Marching UI

React components and routes for the simulator UI.

- `components/` – presentational and container components
- `page.tsx` – entry point

Manual test:
- Open /marching
- Try commands: FALL IN, FORWARD MARCH, HALT, LEFT FACE, RIGHT FLANK, TO THE REAR
- Observe JSON state updates and errors for out-of-context commands.
