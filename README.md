## Marching Simulator – AI Implementation Prep

- Implementation prompt: see `PROMPT.md`.
- Place the 24-page spec PDF at `docs/spec/marching-simulator-spec.pdf`.
- Use the AI docs structure under `docs/ai/` to extract requirements, plan, and trace implementations:
	- `docs/ai/analysis/*` – requirements, glossary, use cases
	- `docs/ai/plan/*` – implementation plan, test plan
	- `docs/ai/tracing/traceability.md`
	- `docs/ai/CHANGELOG.md`

Open a PR using `.github/pull_request_template.md` and keep traceability up to date.
